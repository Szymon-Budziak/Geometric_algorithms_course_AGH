# Geometric algorithms exercises solutions
This is the repository with solutions from Geometric algorithms (Algorytmy geometryczne) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me. All codes are written in English but the content of the labs is in Polish. Also all codes are written in Python in jupyter notebook according to the PEP 8 style.
## Table of contents
Table of contents consists of specific sections in repository. Each section consists of lab content, a solution and a report that explains each step.
