# Geometric algorithms course at AGH UST
The repository with solutions from Geometric algorithms (Algorytmy geometryczne) lab classes at the AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me and codes written during lab classes. All codes are written in English but the content of the labs is in Polish. The leading programming language during this course was Python. Solutions were written in Jupyter Notebook according to the PEP 8 style.
## Table of contents
Table of contents consists of specific sections in repository. Each section consists of lab content, a solution and a report that explains each step.
