# Geometric_algorithms_exercises_solutions
This is the repository with solutions from Geometric algorithms (Algorytmy geometryczne) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me. All codes are written in English but the content of the exercises is in Polish. Also all codes are written in Python in jupyter notebook according to the PEP 8 style..

## Licence
If you use this repository/code for classes or for something else, please give me a star or a fork :). It will help me know that my work is important and useful to someone.
